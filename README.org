#+title: Develop a Game for an NES

* Setup
[[https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Programming_guide][This link]] seems to be a good place to start.

In particular, I installed ~cc65~ with Homebrew and I am using ~fceux~ as an emulator. Still need to find some nice Emacs syntax highlighting for 6502 assembly.

* TODO Get a single white line written to the screen
* TODO Set up some concrete goals and put them on git
